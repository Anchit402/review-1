            <p>The <strong>Kansai region</strong> (関西地方, Kansai-chihō) or the Kinki region (近畿地方, Kinki-chihō), lies in the southern-central region of Japan's main island Honshū.[4] The region includes the prefectures of Mie, Nara, Wakayama, Kyoto, Osaka, Hyōgo and Shiga, sometimes Fukui, Tokushima and Tottori.
